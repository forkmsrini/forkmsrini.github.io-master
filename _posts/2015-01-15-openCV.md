title: How To Setup OpenCV on Mac? [Tech]

###The Plot
I had an issue with upgrading to OS X Yosemite (10.10) and then had to flash the HDD. Hence, I had to re-install all the libraries and programs I required to get working again. 

###A Background
The setup of OpenCV is mysterious. Although there are many resources available on the www, I couldn't find a near and minimalistic setup routine. So I started to search franticly and found few bits and pieces scattered.  I shall put this together here and keep it sufficiently short. 
 
 I assume that the OS is at  10.10 or above. The additionally required programs are:
 
 1. Xcode
 2. Command line tools. See [this](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/) for help.
 3. [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/). Developed by Kitware.

###The Gimmick

#####Step 1: Getting openCV
Download [openCV](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0-beta.zip). Version 3.0 B is available whilst writing this post. The download begins from the Git repo. Once the download is complete, unzip the package on your machine. Location: `/usr/anyWhere/openCV`.

#####Step 2: Create dir(s) for building libs
Create two new folders inside the openCV directory and name those folder as staticLib and sharedLib respectively.

```
$ cd ~/openCV/			//go to the openCV folder and open
$ mkdir staticLib		//create a new dir called staticLibs
$ cd ..					//move back to openCV folder
$ mkdir sharedLib		//create a new dir called sharedLibs
```
#####Step 3: Build Static Libraries
* Open CMake.
* Click `Browse Source...` button and navigate to the openCV folder. You should be at `~/openCV`.
* Click `Browse Build...` button and navigate to your staticLib folder. You should be at `~/openCV/staticLib`.
* Hit the configure button. Once you click configure, you'll have to select the mode of generation. Choose `Unix-Makefile` and confirm by pressing `OK`. At this point, CMake will preform tests. You must see the content holder filled with entries in red. 

Now ensure you carefully *`UNCHECK`* the following:

* `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`
* `BUILD_TESTS`
* `WITH_1394`
*  `WITH_FFMPEG`

Add the following:

* Search for `CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` then add this path `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk`.
* Search for `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURE` and add `x86_64` to the value attribute.

Click `Configure`. Then click `Generate`. Once CMake completes generating open the Terminal and type the following:

```
$ cd ~/openCV/staticLib/
$ make
$ sudo make install		//may require system admin password
```
Now, static libraries are successfully installed.

#####Step 4: Build Shared Libraries
To build shareLib, we'll follow almost the same steps as above.

* Click `Browse Source...` button and navigate to the openCV folder. You should be at `~/openCV`.
* Click `Browse Build...` button and navigate to your sharedLib folder. You should be at `~/openCV/sharedLib`.
* Hit the configure button. Once you click configure, you'll have to select the mode of generation. Choose `Unix-Makefile` and confirm by pressing `OK`. At this point, CMake will preform tests. You must see the content holder filled with entries in red. 

Now ensure you carefully *`UNCHECK`* the following:

* `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`
* `BUILD_TESTS`
* `WITH_1394`
*  `WITH_FFMPEG`

Add the following:

* Search for `CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` then add this path `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk`.
* Search for `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURE` and add `x86_64` to the value attribute.

Click `Configure`. Then click `Generate`. Once CMake completes generating open the Terminal and type the following:

```
$ cd ~/openCV/sharedLib/
$ make
$ sudo make install		//may require system admin password
```
Now, shared libraries are successfully installed.

OpenCV is successfully installed. You are all set to build your first program!
