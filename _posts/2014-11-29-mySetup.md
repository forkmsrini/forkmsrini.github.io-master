title: My Setup Tour [Tech]
comments: True
---
For a little over a year now, I have been following the [Setup Interview](http://usesthis.com/). This site interviews famous tech people and asks them the following questions: 1. Who are you, and what do you do? 2. What hardware do you use? 3. And what software? 4. What would be your dream setup? Also, some YouTubers I follow like [@Jonathan Morrison](https://twitter.com/tldtoday) and [@Marques Brownlee](https://twitter.com/MKBHD) have done setup tour projects. 

Since I can't land myself an interview over with [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/) or make a video out of it, I will do so here in this post.

### The Hardware
I use an early 2013 MacBook Pro with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor, 8 gigs of RAM and 500 GB HDD. This is the best piece of hardware that I have owned thus far and enjoy juicing it. Even though the 15-inch MBP is a bit bulky, I carry it around with me, always. This serves me well as my PC and work machine. 

In addition to this, I use a [Logitech Performance MX](http://tinyurl.com/m7z6fdl) mouse. Again, this is the best mouse I have used and shall probably never go back to using Apple’s Magic Mouse/Track pad. I also carry few connectors for the laptop, as these are not commonly available around here. My go to earphone are the [Audio Technica ATH-M50](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/0edf909675b1be4d/) and [Sony MDR-XB30EX](http://www.sony.co.in/product/mdr-xb30ex) IEMs. I use a [Nexus 5](www.google.co.in/nexus/5/) as my daily driver.

### The Software
Since I haven’t identified my go-to "language," I have a lot of choices and IDEs to work with. First off, [MATLAB](http://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) is golden and I have been using it since my undergrad days. Then, I use [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/downloads/) for many of the Java programs. [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is the text editor that I feel most comfortable to use (because of the customisations and themes mainly). [Enthought Canopy](https://store.enthought.com/) (free edition) is the Python editor. I like to use [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/) as an alternate to the terminal which made the dreadful 'T' experience much better.  The list of other programs installed is: [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html), [Torch 7](https://github.com/torch/torch7), [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/), [Knime](https://www.knime.org/downloads/knime/macosx) and many more (a lot!). I have this clutter, as there is a demand to program in multiple languages across various platforms at which I hope to become good at some time soon!

For versions control I use [GitHub](https://github.com/) and  [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) for file transfers to the local server. I use [texMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) Latex editor to prepare formal documents like papers, reports etc. A trivial, yet very useful software is [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) which keeps my screen awake while I read papers at length. [Alfredapp](http://www.alfredapp.com/) is a darn good app! I use [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run a flavour of Window and Ubuntu on my Mac. Beside these, I have [Microsoft Office Suite](www.microsoft.com/mac), Photoshop CS6 and [TeamViewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/hi/index.aspx) (remote access to my lab computer) installed. Google Chrome best fits my needs as I can share history and bookmarks across devices and I rarely close tabs. [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com) is my to-do list app and I use [PushBullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) to mirror my phone's notification on my computer. 

Many of the software that I use are openly available or at least available for free for personal use.

### Dream Setup

Since it is a 'dream setup,' I would like to have a 4K monitor (or even QHD) as the display unit. I could use my MBP for couple of years more before an upgrade. A MacBook Air (for the form factor alone) with higher memory and speed would be my choice. No wire and cords. Wireless charging on all devices. Batteries should never run dry! 



Or Tony Stark's Iron Man Setup!

I would love to hear about the setup and software consumption of others and try to improve on my existing environment. Comment below or write to me.
